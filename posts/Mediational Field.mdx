Along with the illusory music of Mediational Field, I seem to have intercepted rising second-class talent—the way to understand the country and ostensibly blend into it. The thinking is detached from ordinary people, and they do not understand their attitude of copying what they say. Now it takes 48 hours for nucleic acid to enter and leave the school, and it is also a bus in Nanjing. My roommate said that if I want to enter the school, I need to go outside for 7 days and 5 inspections. I fell into an empty and illusory state. Now this kind of bizarre, all kinds of bulls, demons, snakes and gods are dancing wildly.

I have been thinking about whether it is the government that determines the ideological trend of the people, or is it the people who decide the government is like this. Hegel said, "China has no history, only cycles." We, a nation disguised as a modern state, began with the overwhelming Han Chinese and ruled over all the ethnic minorities in the territory. I thought of Han, a Xibe people who had been completely sinicized, with a sad heart: the disappearance and fusion of a culture. And those ethnic groups that have not yet been assimilated are under enormous pressure and have less power than ordinary Han people. The blockade of the media has made the ethnic minorities of these huge groups have nowhere to speak. Occasionally, Han Chinese who have returned from Xinjiang have revealed one or two local conditions. I was born as a Han Chinese but couldn't get it to happen because of the heavy taxes and the mental weight of being an "angry Chinese".

When I look at everything around me, I realize that I seem to be at the forefront of people's wisdom. The steps toward criticism are getting heavier and heavier, and the people around me who are fooled by fake news don’t understand me. I also understand that I can't change the general environment, only a winding road is clearly placed in front of me. With the national development engine - real estate stalling, the spare high-tech and industrial upgrading engine has stalled several times. I have already predicted that 2022 will be the dark beginning of the next 20 years. Post-00s - our generation, when we were young, lived on the miracle of the country's rapid development. Sunshine's self-confidence will be crushed to shreds before the horrors we face in the future. Just as Li Hongzhang signed a treaty of humiliation and betrayal of the country, but the domestic media propaganda victory at that time, the ignorance and self-confidence brought by the isolation of the country are flooded in this society.

Independent thinking is a rare anti-war aspirin that can save me from falsehood, and at the same time let me face the pain of life. I know, I know, just as my logic is fragmented, so is my mood. This time, I have learned how to make good progress, tolerate everything around me, and make good arrangements for my future. run is just a way to make one's life better, the political system is not the factor that determines the quality of life, but ignorance. People in the local area network accept the exaggerated news, the outside world of the Internet has been vilified, and the truth is also vulnerable in the face of lies.

# 媒介野
> 《红辣椒》观后感

伴随着媒介野（Mediational Field）虚幻的音乐，我似乎截取了上升二等人才——明白这个国家，表面融入其中的通道。思维是超脱于普通人的，不明白他们人云亦云的态度。现在出入学校需要48小时核酸，在南京坐公交也是。舍友说现在外地想进学校要现在外面7天5检，我陷入了一种空明、虚幻的状态。现在这种光怪陆离，各种牛魔蛇神全魔乱舞。

我一直在想，是政府决定了百姓的思潮，还是这样的百姓决定了政府都是这样。黑格尔说过，“中国没有历史，只有循环。”我们这个伪装成现代国家的民族，由汉人占据压倒性的地位为开端，由统治所有境内少数民族为章节。我想到了韩——一个完全被汉化了的锡伯族，心生可悲：一种文化的消逝与交融。而那些现在还没有被同化的民族承受着巨大的压力，比普通汉人所拥有的权力都小。媒体的封锁，更是让这些巨大人群的少数民族无处发声，偶有新疆回来的汉人透露一二当地的情况。我生为汉人却无从为其发生，因为背负着繁重的税收和作为“生气的中国人”的精神重压。

当我审视周遭一切的时候，我意识到我似乎走在民智的前端。坚定走向批判的步伐愈发的沉重，被假新闻愚昧的周遭不理解我。我也明白，我改变不了大环境，只有run一条曲折小路明晃晃的摆在我面前。随着国民发展引擎——房地产的熄火，备用的高科技、产业升级的发动机几经停滞，我已经预料到2022年是未来20年黑暗的开端。00后——我们这一代人，小时候生活在国家高速发展的奇迹上，阳光的自信在未来面对的惨目忍睹前将被碾成粉碎。就像李鸿章签署屈辱卖国条约，当时国内媒体却宣传胜利了一样，闭关锁国带来的愚昧和自大会充斥在这个社会。

独立思考是一剂难得的抗战阿司匹林，能将我从虚假中拯救出来，也同时让我直面生活的惨痛。我知道，我知道，就像我的逻辑支离破碎一样，我的心情也是。这回我学会了，厚积薄发，隐忍周遭的一切，好好安排自己未来。run只是让自己生活更好的一种方式，政治制度并不是决定生活质量的因素，而是愚昧。局域网中的人们接受着渲染过的消息，外面互联网的世界已经被丑化，真相在谎言面前也不堪一击。
