[中文版](#西朝鲜在路上)

Low fertility rate, failed industrial upgrading, high concentration of power, bursting real estate bubble, capital flight and many other factors make me unable to see the future of this country. "This year could be the best year in the next five years."

Today the school has been unblocked, but there is no official announcement, and some are only news from acquaintances. It is said to be unblocking, but it is only that the system application no longer needs the approval of the guide and the secretary of the hospital, and it is limited to activities in the city. I excitedly proposed to my friends who had free time in Baoyan the previous plan to travel to neighboring provinces by car, but most of them hesitated and refused. "Covid-19 danger" and "school punishment" are etched in their mind like a stencil. I moved out the relevant data and school rules explained that it had no effect, but they were indifferent.

They were all numb, or rather tamed. Of course, no matter how serious the epidemic is outside, except for students, they can enter and leave the school freely. This reminds me of the sign hanging at the entrance of the concession - "Chinese and dogs are not allowed to enter". Any dissent to school policy is considered a mentally dysfunctional radical. This injustice and abuse of power permeates not only schools, but society as a whole. Even college students have lost their most basic pursuit of freedom and fairness. I can already imagine the silence of most people in the face of tyranny. Low civic awareness is one reason, and another is the isolation of the country - the unilateral control of information by political parties has reached a sensational level.

Why "most Chinese universities have no knowledge" - only the pursuit of interests? Why "China's history has been going back and forth" - from centralization to collapse, from collapse to centralization? Will the next collapse be an external war or an internal revolution?

I don't understand, but I know that "West Korea" is on its way to North Korea and will never return, and the suffering of the people has only just begun...

# 西朝鲜在路上
> 对现状的失望和未来的迷茫

低生育率，产业升级失败，高度集权，房地产泡沫破碎，资本外逃等诸多因素让我看不到这个国家的未来。“在未来五年里今年可能是最好的一年了。”

今天学校解封了，却无官方通知，有的只有熟人口口相传的消息。说是解封，但也只是系统申请暂时不再需要导员和院书记审批，也仅限于本市内的活动。我兴奋地和保研空闲的朋友们提出先前自驾游邻省的计划，但多数犹豫了，拒绝了。“新冠危险”，“学校处分”思想钢印般刻在脑里。我搬出相关新冠数据和学校规定解释没有影响，但他们无动于衷。

他们都麻木了，或者说已经被驯服了。当然，外面再怎么严重的疫情，除了学生都是可以自由进出学校的。这让我想到了当初租界门口挂着的牌子——“华人与狗不得入内“。任何对学校政策的异议都被视为心理不正常的激进分子。这种不公平与权力的滥用不仅弥漫在学校，还在整个社会。连大学生都失去了最基本对自由和公平的追求，我已经能想象到多数民众面对暴政的默不作声了。公民意识低是一个原因，还有一个是闭关锁国——政党对信息单方面的把控已经达到了耸人听闻的程度。

为什么“中国多数大学没有知识”——只有对利益的追求？为什么“中国的历史一直在往复”——从集权走向崩溃，从崩溃走向集权？下一次崩溃是外部战争还是内部革命？

我想不明白，但我知道“西朝鲜”正在前往北朝鲜的路上一去不复返，人民的苦难才刚刚开始……
